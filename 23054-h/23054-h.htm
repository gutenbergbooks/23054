    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the day before Christmas of the year 1832, my friend Wilfred, with his
      double-bass slung over his back, and I, with my violin under my arm,
      started to walk from the Black Forest to Heidelberg. It was unusually
      snowy weather; as far as we could see across the great, deserted plain,
      there was no trace of road nor path. The wind kept up its harsh aria with
      monotonous persistency, and Wilfred, with his flattened wallet at his
      belt, and the vizor of his cap drawn over his eyes, moved on before me,
      straddling the drifts with his long, heron legs, and whistling a gay tune
      to keep up his spirits. Now and then, he would turn around with a waggish
      smile, and cry: "Comrade, let's have the waltz from 'Robin,' I feel like
      dancing." A burst of laughter followed these words, and then the good
      fellow would resume his march courageously. I followed on as well as I
      could, up to my knees in snow, and I felt a sense of melancholy take
      possession of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spires of Heidelberg began to appear on the extreme horizon, and we
      hoped to reach there before nightfall. It was then about five o'clock in
      the afternoon, and great flakes of snow were whirling through the gray
      atmosphere. Suddenly we heard the sound of a horse approaching from behind
      us. When the rider was within twenty yards of us, he moderated his speed,
      studying us meanwhile with a sidelong glance. We returned his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picture to yourself a large man, with reddish hair and beard, in a
      three-cornered hat and loose fox-skin pelisse; his arms buried to the
      elbows in fur gloves. He carried a handsome valise behind him, resting on
      the haunches of his powerful stallion. He was evidently some alderman or
      burgomaster or personage of like importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho! Ho! my good fellows!" he cried; "you are on your way to Heidelberg to
      perform, I see." Wilfred surveyed the traveler from the corner of his eye,
      and replied briefly: "Is that of any interest to you, sir?" "Yes, for in
      that case I wish to give you a bit of advice." "Advice?" "Precisely; if
      you wish it." Wilfred started on without replying. I noticed that the
      traveler's appearance was like that of an enormous cat; his ears wide
      apart, his eyelids half closed, with a bristling mustache, and a fatherly,
      almost caressing manner. "My friend," he continued, addressing himself to
      me, "frankly, you will do well to retrace your steps." "Why so, sir?" "The
      great Maestro Pimenti has just now announced a concert to take place at
      Heidelberg on Christmas day. The entire city will be there, and you will
      not earn a kreutzer." At this point, Wilfred turned around ill-humoredly:
      "We care not a sou for your Maestro nor all the Pimentis in Christendom,"
      he said; "look at this young fellow here, without even the sign of a beard
      on his chin! He has never yet played outside of the ale-houses of the
      Black Forest, for the woodcutters and charcoal-women to dance; and yet
      this boy, with his long yellow curls and big blue eyes, defies all your
      Italian impostors. His left hand is possessed of inimitable melody, grace,
      and suppleness, and his right of a power to draw the bow, that the
      Almighty rarely accords us mortals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! ho! Indeed!" returned the other. "It is just as I tell you," Wilfred
      replied, and he resumed his pace, blowing on his fingers that were red
      with the cold, I saw that he was ridiculing the horseman, who continued to
      follow us at an easy trot. We continued thus for a full half mile in
      silence. Suddenly the stranger said to us abruptly: "Whatever skill you
      may possess, go back to the Black Forest; we have vagabonds enough in
      Heidelberg without you to increase the number. I give you good advice,
      particularly under the existing circumstances; you will do well to profit
      by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred, now thoroughly out of patience, was about to reply, but the
      traveler, urging his horse into a gallop, had already crossed the broad
      Avenue d'Electeur. An immense flock of crows flew up from the plain and
      seemed to be following him, filling the heavens with their cawing. We
      reached Heidelberg at about seven o'clock, and we did indeed see Pimenti's
      magnificent posters on all the walls of the city, which read: "Grand
      Concert Solo."
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening in visiting the various inns, we met many old comrades
      from the Black Forest, who engaged us to play in their troupe. There was
      old Bremer, the 'cellist, his two sons, Ludwig and Karl, both good second
      violins; Heinrich Siebel, the clarionet player, and Bertha with her harp;
      Wilfred with his double-bass and I with my violin made up the number. We
      agreed to travel together after the Christmas concert and divide the
      proceeds among us. Wilfred had already hired a room for us both on the
      sixth floor of the Pied de Mouton Tavern, which stood halfway down the
      Holdergasse, and for it he was to pay four kreutzers a day. Properly
      speaking, it was nothing but a garret, but fortunately there was a stove
      in it, and we lighted a fire to dry ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were comfortably seated, toasting chestnuts over the fire and
      enjoying a jug of wine, little Annette, the housemaid, appeared in a black
      calico dress and velvet turban, with rosy cheeks and lips like a cluster
      of cherries. She came running up the stairs, gave a hasty knock and threw
      herself joyfully into my arms. I had known the pretty little girl for a
      long time; we were of the same village, and if truth must be told, her
      sparkling eyes and frolicsome ways had quite won my heart. "I came up to
      have a little talk with you," she said, dropping into a chair. "I saw you
      come up a moment ago and here I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to chatter away, asking for this one or that one of the village
      and hardly giving me time to reply. Every now and then she would pause and
      look at me with the greatest tenderness. We might have continued thus
      until the next morning had not Dame Grédel Dick begun to call from the
      foot of the stairs: "Annette! Annette! Are you never coming?" "Right away,
      ma'am!" answered the poor child reluctantly. She tapped me lightly on the
      cheek and ran toward the door; but just as she was crossing the threshold,
      she suddenly stopped. "By the way," she cried, "I was forgetting to tell
      you; but perhaps you have heard about it?" "About what?" "The death of our
      precentor, Zahn." "But how does that, affect us?" "To be sure; only see
      that your passport is all right Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock they
      will come to examine it. Everybody is being arrested in the last
      fortnight. The precentor was assassinated last night in the library of
      Saint Christopher's Chapel, and only a week ago, old Ulmet Elias, the
      sacrificer, was similarly murdered in the Rue des Juifs. Some days before
      that Christina Haas, the old midwife, was also killed, as well as the
      agate dealer Seligmann of the Rue Durlach. So look out for yourself, dear
      Kasper, and see that your passport is all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was speaking, Dame Grédel's voice came again from below:
      "Annette! will you come here? The good-for-nothing child, leaving me to do
      all the work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sound of men's voices calling for wine, beer, ham, or sausages
      mingled with her own. Further delay was out of the question. Annette
      hastened down the stairs, crying as she went: "Goodness, ma'am! what has
      happened? One would think that the house were afire!" Wilfred crossed the
      room and closed the door behind her; then returning to his chair, we
      looked at each other, not without a feeling of apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is singular news," he said; "your passport is all right, I suppose?"
      "Certainly," And I produced my papers. "Good! Mine is too, for I had it
      made out just before leaving. But nevertheless, these murders do not augur
      us any good. I am afraid we shall not be able to do much business here;
      many of the families will be in mourning; and then, too, the bother and
      pettifogging of the authorities." "Pshaw! you take too gloomy a view of
      it," I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      We continued to discuss these singular happenings until after midnight.
      The glow from our little stove lighted up the angle of the roof, the
      square window with its three cracked panes, the straw strewn about the
      floor, the blackened beams propped against each other, and the little
      firwood table that cast its uncertain shadow upon the worm-eaten ceiling.
      From time to time, a mouse, enticed by the warmth, would dart like an
      arrow along the wall. The wind howled in the chimney and whirled the snow
      about the gutters. I was dreaming of Annette; the silence was complete.
      Suddenly Wilfred exclaimed, throwing off his jacket: "It is time for
      sleep. Put another stick on the fire and we will go to bed!" "We can't do
      better than that," I replied. So saying, I drew off my boots, and a moment
      later we stretched out on the straw with the coverlid tucked under our
      chins and a log under our heads for a pillow. Wilfred lost no time in
      getting to sleep. The light from the stove flickered and trembled; the
      wind redoubled its force outside, and as I lay thus with a sense of
      perfect contentment, I, too, dozed off. At about two o'clock in the
      morning I was awakened by a strange noise. I thought at first that it was
      a cat running along the gutter, but, putting my ear to the wall, my
      uncertainty was at once dispelled; somebody was walking on the roof. I
      nudged Wilfred. "Sh!" he whispered, pressing my hand; he had heard it,
      too. The firelight was casting its last shadows on the decrepit walls. I
      was considering whether I would get up or not, when the little window,
      held only by a bit of brick, slowly opened. A pale face with shining eyes,
      red hair, and quivering cheeks appeared in the opening and gazed into the
      interior of the chamber. Our fear was so great that we hadn't strength
      left to cry out. At length the man glided through the sash and let himself
      down into the loft without a sound. The man, short and thick-set, the
      muscles of his face contracted like a tiger about to spring, was none
      other than the ingenuous person who had volunteered his advice on the road
      to Heidelberg. But how different he seemed to us now! In spite of the
      bitter cold, he was in his shirt sleeves, dressed only in a pair of
      breeches, woolen stockings, and silver buckled shoes. A long,
      blood-stained knife glittered in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred and I thought our last hour had surely come. But he did not appear
      to see us in the oblique shadow of the loft, notwithstanding that the fire
      started up again in the cold draft from the open window. He squatted down
      on a chair and began to shiver in a strange manner. Suddenly he fixed his
      yellowish-green eyes upon me; his nostrils dilated and he watched me for a
      full minute, while the blood froze in my veins. Then turning toward the
      stove, he gave a hoarse cough, like the purring of a cat, without moving a
      muscle of his face. He drew a large watch from his breeches pocket, made a
      gesture as if looking at the time, and either inadvertently or purposely
      laid it on the table. This done, he rose as if undecided, looked
      doubtfully at the window, hesitated, and finally disappeared through the
      door, leaving it wide open behind him. I sprang up to turn the lock;
      already the man's footsteps creaked on the staircase two floors below. An
      irresistible curiosity asserted itself over my fear, and hearing a window
      open, which looked upon the court, I approached the sash of the little
      winding staircase on the same side of the house. The courtyard, from where
      I stood, lay at a dizzy depth, and a wall from fifty to sixty feet high
      divided it. On the right of the wall was the yard of a pork butcher; on
      the left, the inn yard of the Pied de Mouton. The top of this wall, which
      was overgrown with damp mosses and that sort of vegetation that thrives in
      dark places, extended in a straight line from the window, which the man
      had just opened, to the roof of a large, sombre-looking dwelling, built in
      the rear of the Bergstrasse. I took all this in at a glance while the moon
      shone between the heavy, snow-laden clouds, and I shuddered as I saw the
      man flee along the wall, his head bent forward and the knife still in his
      hand, while the wind howled lugubriously around him. He reached the
      opposite roof and disappeared. I thought I must be dreaming. For some
      moments I stood there, open-mouthed with wonder, my breast bare, and hair
      tossed about, drenched by the sleet that fell from the roof. At length
      recovering from my bewilderment, I returned to the loft and found Wilfred,
      who looked at me with a haggard expression and was mumbling a prayer. I
      hastened to bolt the door, dress myself, and replenish the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said my comrade, sitting up. "Well," I rejoined, "we have escaped
      this time, but if that fellow didn't see us, it was only because our time
      has not yet come." "You are right!" he cried. "He is one of the murderers
      Annette spoke of. Great Heavens! What a face! And what a knife!" And he
      fell back on the straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      I emptied at a draft what wine still remained in the jug, and then, as the
      fire started up again, diffusing a grateful warmth through the chamber,
      and the lock appeared sufficiently strong, my courage began to revive. But
      the watch was still there and the man might return for it. The thought
      filled us with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is our next move?" asked Wilfred. "The best thing we can do is
      to strike out at once for the Black Forest." "Why so?" "I have no further
      desire to figure on the double-bass; you may do as you like." "Why should
      we leave? We have committed no crime." "Speak low!" he replied, "that one
      word 'crime' might hang us. We poor devils are made to serve as examples
      for others. They don't bother their heads much to find out whether we are
      guilty or not. If they should discover that watch here, it would be
      enough." "Look here, Wilfred! It won't do to lose your head! A crime has
      undoubtedly been committed in this neighborhood, but what should honest
      men do under the circumstances? Instead of running away from Justice, they
      should try to aid it." "How aid it?" "The simplest way would be to take
      this watch to the bailiff and tell him what has passed." "Never! I
      wouldn't even dare to touch it!" "Very well, I will take it myself, but
      now let's go back to bed and try to get some more sleep if we can." "I
      don't care to sleep." "Well, light your pipe, then, and we will talk while
      we wait for daylight. Let's go downstairs, there may be some one there
      still." "I would rather stay here." "All right." And we sat down again
      before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as dawn appeared, I took the watch from the table. It was a fine
      one with minute and second hands. Wilfred seemed somewhat reassured.
      "Kasper," he said, "on second thoughts, it seems more suitable for me to
      go to the bailiff. You are too young to take part in such matters. You
      would make a mess of it when you tried to explain the affair." "Just as
      you like," I replied. "Yes, it would look odd for a man of my years to
      send a mere child in my place." "Very good; I understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the watch, but I believe that only his pride drove him to this
      resolution. He would have been ashamed to show less courage than I before
      his comrades. We went down from the loft in a thoughtful mood. As we
      crossed the alleyway that comes out on the Rue Saint Christopher, we heard
      the clicking of glasses. I recognized the voice of old Bremer and his
      sons, Ludwig and Karl. "By Jove," said I, "it wouldn't be a bad idea to
      take a glass before we start." I pushed open the door of the tap-room as I
      spoke, and we found all our company gathered there, their instruments
      variously deposited about the room. We were received with shouts of
      satisfaction and places were quickly made for us at the table. "Ho! Good
      morning, comrades," said Bremer; "more snow and wind. All the taverns are
      full of people, and every bottle that is opened means a florin in our
      pockets." I saw little Annette looking as fresh and fair as a rose, and
      smiling fondly at me with her lips and eyes. This sight reanimated me. It
      was I who got the daintiest morsels, and whenever she approached to set a
      glass of wine at my elbow, she touched me caressingly on the shoulder, and
      I thought, with a beating heart, of the days when we used to go
      chestnutting together. But in spite of this, the pale face of our strange
      visitor of the night before recurred to me from time to time, and made me
      tremble. I looked at Wilfred; he, too, seemed thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight o'clock came and our party was about to start out, when the door was
      thrown open, and three big fellows, with lead-colored complexions, their
      eyes shining like rats, and their hats awry, appeared on the threshold,
      followed by several others of a like description. One of them, with a
      razor-back nose, and with a heavy club bound to his wrist, stepped
      forward, crying: "Your passports, gentlemen!" Each one hastened to comply
      with the request. Unfortunately, Wilfred, who stood near the stove, was
      seized with a sudden trembling. The officer's experienced eye detected his
      agitation, and as he paused in his reading to give him a questioning look,
      my comrade conceived the unlucky idea of slipping the watch into his boot;
      but before it had reached its destination, the official slapped his hand
      against the other's hip, and said jeeringly: "Something seems to trouble
      you here." To everybody's amazement, Wilfred was seized with a fainting
      spell and dropped upon a bench pale as death. Without further ceremony,
      Madoc, the Chief of Police, pulled up his trousers' leg and drew out the
      watch with a burst of evil laughter. He had no sooner glanced at it,
      however, than he became sober, and, turning to his men, he cried in a
      terrible voice: "Let no one leave the room! We have caught the whole band
      at last! Look! this is the watch of Dean Daniel Van den Berg. Bring hither
      the handcuffs!" This order chilled us to the marrow. A tumult followed,
      and I, believing that we were lost, slid under a bench near the wall. As I
      was watching them chain the hands of poor old Bremer and his sons, Karl
      and Ludwig, together with Heinrich and Wilfred, I felt Annette's little
      hand brush against my cheek and she drew me gently toward her&mdash;slowly
      and quietly toward the open cellar door. I was unnoticed in the general
      confusion; I slipped within; the door closed behind me. It was but the
      matter of a second. Scarcely had I concealed myself, before I heard my
      poor comrades depart; then all became silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will leave you to imagine the nature of my reflections during an entire
      day, crouched down behind a wine cask with my legs gathered under me, and
      realizing that if a dog should enter the cellar, if the landlady should
      take the notion to come downstairs to fill a pitcher, if the cask should
      run out before night and were to be replaced; in short, if the slightest
      thing went amiss, it would be all up with me. All these thoughts and a
      thousand others passed through my mind, and I fancied that I already saw
      my comrades being led to execution. Little Annette, no less anxious than
      myself, closed the door prudently each time that she came up from the
      cellar. At last, I heard the old woman cry: "Leave the door open! Are you
      mad to lose half your time in shutting it?" After that the door remained
      ajar, and from my nook in the shadows I could see the tables gradually
      filling with new customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stories, discussions, and exclamations concerning the famous band of
      robbers reached my ears. "Oh! the rascals!" cried one; "thank Heaven they
      are caught. What a scourge they have been to Heidelberg! No one dared risk
      himself in the streets after ten o'clock, and even business was beginning
      to suffer; but now things are changed and in a fortnight it will all be
      forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those musicians of the Black Forest are a lot of bandits!" chimed in
      another; "they make their way into the houses under pretext of playing,
      and meanwhile they are examining the locks, bolts, chests, and windows,
      and some fine morning we hear that such a one has had his throat cut in
      his bed; that his wife has been murdered, his children strangled, and his
      house rifled from top to bottom. The wretches should be strung up without
      mercy! Then we might have some peace." "The whole village will turn out to
      see them hanged," said Mother Grédel, "and as for me, it will be the
      happiest day of my life." "Do you know, if it hadn't been for Dean
      Daniel's watch, no trace of them would have been found. Last night the
      watch disappeared, and this morning the Dean notified the police. An hour
      later, Madoc bagged them all! Ha! Ha! Ha!" The entire roomful burst out
      laughing, and I trembled with shame, indignation, and fear in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the night drew on. Only a few loungers remained. The people of
      the inn, who had sat up the night before, were anxious to get to bed. I
      heard the landlady yawn and mutter: "Oh, dear! How long before we can get
      some sleep?" Most of the tipplers comprehended the force of this remark
      and withdrew; only one remained, sitting half asleep before his glass. The
      watchman, going his rounds, woke him up and he went off grumbling and
      staggering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last!" I said to myself; "this is good luck; Mother Grédel has gone to
      bed and Annette will not be slow in getting me out." With this agreeable
      prospect in view, I had already stretched out my stiffened limbs, when
      Dame Grédel's voice reached my ear: "Annette, go and lock up, and don't
      forget to bolt the door! I am going down cellar." It appeared that this
      was a wise custom of hers to assure herself that everything was right.
      "But, madame," stammered the girl, "the cask isn't empty. You needn't
      bother to&mdash;" "Mind your own business," interrupted the mistress,
      whose candle was already lighting up the passageway. I had barely time to
      squat down again behind the cask, when the old woman, stooping beneath the
      low, dingy ceiling, passed from one keg to another, mumbling as she went:
      "Oh! the little wretch. How she lets the wine leak. I'll teach her to
      close the spigots tighter; did ever any one see the like?" The candle
      threw great shadows against the damp wall. I huddled closer and closer.
      Suddenly, just as I thought the visit happily ended, and was beginning to
      breathe easier again, I heard the old creature give a sigh so long and so
      full of woe that I knew something unusual was happening. I risked just the
      least glance, and I saw Dame Grédel Dick, her under jaw dropped and her
      eyes sticking out of her head, staring at the bottom of the barrel behind
      which I lay. She had caught sight of one of my feet underneath the joist
      that served as a wedge to keep the cask in place. She evidently believed
      she had discovered the chief of the robbers concealed there for the
      purpose of strangling her during the night. I formed a sudden resolution.
      "Madame, for God's sake, have pity on me!" I cried: "I am&mdash;" Without
      looking at me, or listening to a word I said, she set up an ear-splitting
      shriek and started up the stairs as quickly as her great weight would
      permit. Seized with inexpressible terror, I clung to her skirt and went
      down on my knees. This only made matters worse. "Help! seize the assassin!
      Oh, my God! release me! Take my money! Oh! Oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was horrible. In vain did I cry: "Only look at me, my dear madame; I am
      not what you think me!" She was beside herself with fear; she raved and
      screamed in such piercing tones that had we not been underground, the
      whole neighborhood would inevitably have been aroused. In this extremity,
      consulting only my rage, I overturned her, and gaining the door before
      her, I slammed it in her face, taking care to slip the bolt. During the
      struggle the candle had been extinguished and Dame Grédel was left in the
      dark. Her cries grew fainter and fainter. I stared at Annette, giddy, and
      with hardly strength enough left to stand. Her agitation equaled mine. We
      neither of us seemed able to speak, and stood listening to the expiring
      cries of the mistress, which soon ceased altogether. The poor woman had
      fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Kasper," cried Annette, wringing her hands, "what is to be done? Fly!
      fly! You may have been heard! Did you kill her?" "Kill her? I?" "I am so
      glad! But fly! I will open the door for you." She unbarred it, and I fled
      into the street, without stopping even to thank her; but I was so
      terrified and there was not a moment to lose. The night was inky black;
      not a star in the sky, and the street lamps unlighted. The weather was
      abominable; it was snowing hard and the wind howled dismally. Not until I
      had run for a good half-hour did I stop to take breath. Imagine my horror
      when I found myself directly opposite the Pied de Mouton Tavern. In my
      terror I had run around the square a dozen times for aught I knew. My legs
      felt like lead and my knees tottered under me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inn, but a moment before deserted, swarmed like a bee-hive, and lights
      danced about from window to window. It was evidently filled with the
      police. And now, at my wits' end, desperate, exhausted with cold and
      hunger, and not knowing where to find refuge, I resolved upon the
      strangest possible course. "By Jove," I said to myself, "as well be hanged
      as leave my bones on the road to the Black Forest." And I walked into the
      tavern with the intention of giving myself up to the officials. Besides
      the fellows with their cocked hats tilted rakishly over their ears, and
      the clubs fastened to their wrists, whom I had already seen in the
      morning, and who were now running here and there, and turning everything
      upside down, there was the bailiff, Zimmer, standing before one of the
      tables, dressed in black, with a grave air and penetrating glance, and
      near him the secretary Roth, with his red wig, imposing countenance, and
      large ears, flat as oyster shells. They paid no attention to my entrance,
      and this circumstance altered my resolution at once. I sat down in a
      corner of the room behind the big cast-iron stove, in company with two or
      three of the neighbors, who had run hither to see what was going on, and I
      ordered a pint of wine and a dish of sauerkraut. Annette came near
      betraying me. "Goodness!" she cried, "is it possible!" But one
      exclamation, more or less, in such a babel of voices possessed but little
      significance. It passed unnoticed, and, while I ate with a ravenous
      appetite, I listened to the examination to which Dame Grédel was subjected
      as she lay back in a large armchair, her hair falling down and her eyes
      bulged out with fright. "How old did the man appear to be?" asked the
      bailiff. "Between forty and fifty, sir. He was an enormous man with black
      side whiskers, or maybe brown, I don't exactly remember, with a long nose
      and green eyes." "Did he have any birthmark or scars?" "I don't remember
      any. He only had a big hammer and pistols." "Very good! And what did he
      say to you?" "He seized me by the throat, but fortunately I screamed so
      loud it frightened him, and I defended myself with my finger-nails. When
      any one tries to murder you, you fight hard for your life, sir." "Nothing
      is more natural or legitimate, madame. Take this down, Roth! The coolness
      of this good woman is remarkable." The rest of the deposition was in the
      same strain. They questioned Annette afterward, but she testified to
      having been so frightened that she could remember nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do," said the bailiff; "if we need anything further, we will
      return to-morrow morning." Everybody withdrew, and I asked Dame Grédel for
      a room for the night. So great had been her fear that she had not the
      slightest recollection of having seen me before. "Annette," said she,
      "Show the gentleman to the little room on the third floor. I can not stand
      on my legs. Oh! dear! what trials we have to bear in this world." She
      began to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette, having lighted a candle, led me up to the little chamber, and
      when we found ourselves alone, she cried innocently: "Oh! Kasper, Kasper!
      Who would have believed that you were one of the band! I can never console
      myself for having loved a robber!" "What! you, too, believe us guilty,
      Annette?" I exclaimed despairingly, dropping into a chair; "that is the
      last straw on the camel's back." "No! no! you can not be. You are too much
      of a gentleman, dear Kasper! And you were so brave to come back." I
      explained to her that I was perishing with cold and hunger, and that that
      was the only consideration which led me to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were left to ourselves for some time; then Annette departed, lest she
      should arouse Madame Grédel's suspicions. Left to myself, after having
      ascertained that the windows were not approached by any wall, and that the
      sashes were securely fastened, I thanked God that I had thus far been
      brought safely through the perils which surrounded me, and then going to
      bed, I was soon fast asleep.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      I got up at about eight o'clock the next morning. It was foggy and dark.
      As I drew aside the hangings of the bed, I noticed that the snow was
      drifted on a level with the windows; the sashes were all white. I began to
      reflect upon the sad condition of my companions; they must have suffered
      with the cold, particularly old Bremer and Bertha, and the idea filled me
      with sorrow. As I was reflecting thus, a strange noise arose outside. It
      drew near the inn, and I sprang anxiously to the window to see if some new
      dangers were threatening. They were bringing the famous band of robbers to
      confront Dame Grédel Dick, who was not yet sufficiently recovered from her
      fright to venture out of doors. My poor comrades came down the street
      between a double file of police, and followed by a crowd of street
      urchins, who screamed and yelled like savages. It seems to me that I can
      still see that terrible scene; poor Bremer chained between his sons,
      Ludwig and Karl, Wilfred behind them, and Bertha bringing up the rear and
      crying piteously: "In the name of Heaven, my masters, have pity on a poor,
      innocent harpist! I kill? I steal? O God! can it be?" She wrung her hands
      distractedly. The others proceeded with bowed heads, their hair falling
      over their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd swarmed into the dark alleyway of the inn. The guards drove back
      the rabble, and the door was closed and barred. The eager crowd remained
      outside, standing ankle-deep in slush, with their noses flattened against
      the panes. A profound silence settled upon the house. Having by this time
      got into my clothes, I opened the door part way to listen, and see if it
      would be possible to escape from my unpleasant quarters. I heard the sound
      of voices and of people moving about on the lower floors, which convinced
      me that the passages were strongly guarded. My door opened on the landing,
      directly opposite the window through which the man had fled two nights
      before. I did not pay any attention to this circumstance at first, but as
      I stood there I suddenly noticed that the window was open, and that there
      was no snow on the sill; approaching it, I saw fresh tracks along the
      wall. I shuddered. The man must have returned last night; perhaps visited
      the inn every night. It was a revelation to me, and at once the mystery
      began to clear up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! if it were only true," I said to myself, "that fortune had placed the
      murderer's fate in my hands, my unhappy fellows would be saved!" And I
      followed with my eyes the footprints, which led with surprising
      distinctness to the opposite roof. At this moment some words fell on my
      ear. The door of the dining hall had just been opened to let in the fresh
      air, and I heard the following conversation: "Do you recall having taken
      part in the murder of Ulmet Elias on the twentieth of this month?" Some
      unintelligible words followed. "Close the door, Madoc!" said the bailiff;
      "the woman is ill." I heard no more. As I stood with my head resting
      against the balusters, a sudden resolution seized me. "I can save my
      comrades!" I exclaimed; "God has pointed out to me the means, and if I
      fail to do my duty, their blood will be upon my head. My self-respect and
      peace of mind will be forever lost, and I shall consider myself the most
      cowardly of wretches." It took me some time, however, to summon up
      resolution enough. Then I went downstairs and entered the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever see this watch before?" the bailiff was saying to Dame
      Grédel. "Do your best to remember!" Without waiting for her answer, I
      stepped forward and replied firmly: "That watch, bailiff? I have seen it
      before in the hands of the murderer himself. I recognize it perfectly, and
      if you will only listen to me, I will agree to deliver the man into your
      hands this very night." Perfect stillness followed my bold declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officials stared at each other, dumfounded; my comrades seemed to
      cheer up a bit. "I am the companion of these unfortunate people," I
      continued, "and I say it without shame, for every one of them is honest,
      even if he is poor, and there is not one among them capable of committing
      the crimes imputed to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again silence followed. Dame Bertha began to weep quietly. At last the
      bailiff aroused himself. Looking at me sharply, he said: "Where do you
      pretend to deliver the assassin into our hands?" "Right here in this very
      house! And to convince you of it, I only ask for a moment's private
      conversation." "Let us hear what you have to say," he replied, rising. He
      motioned Madoc to follow us; the others remained. We left the room. I went
      hastily up the stairs, with the others at my heels. Pausing at the window
      on the third floor, I showed them the man's footprints in the snow. "Those
      are the murderer's tracks!" I said; "he visits this house every night.
      Yesterday he came at two in the morning; last night he returned, and he
      will undoubtedly be back again this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bailiff and Madoc examined the footprints without a word. "How do you
      know that these are the murderer's tracks?" asked the chief of police,
      doubtfully. Thereupon I told him of the man's appearance in our loft. I
      pointed out to them the little window above us through which I had watched
      him as he fled in the moonlight, and which Wilfred had not seen, as he
      remained in bed. I admitted that it was mere chance that had led me to the
      discovery of the tracks made the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is strange!" muttered the bailiff; "this greatly modifies the position
      of the accused. But how do you explain the presence of the robber in the
      cellar?" "That robber was myself." I now related briefly everything that
      had taken place from the time of my comrades' arrest until the moment of
      my flight from the inn. "That will do," said the bailiff; and, turning
      toward the chief of police, he added: "I must admit, Madoc, that the
      depositions of these musicians never seemed to me very conclusive of their
      guilt; moreover, their passports established an alibi difficult to
      controvert. Nevertheless, young man," turning to me, "in spite of the
      plausibility of the proofs you have given us, you must remain in our power
      until they are verified. Keep him in sight, Madoc, and take your measures
      accordingly." The bailiff descended the stairs thoughtfully, and,
      refolding his papers, he said, without continuing the examination: "Let
      the accused be taken back to the prison!" And with a scornful glance at
      the landlady, he departed, followed by the secretary. Madoc alone remained
      with two officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," he said to Dame Grédel, "maintain the strictest secrecy about
      what has happened, and give this brave young man the same room he occupied
      night before last." Madoc's look and emphasis admitted of no reply. Dame
      Grédel swore she would do whatever was required of her if she could only
      be rid of the robbers! Madoc replied: "We shall stay here all day and
      to-night to protect you. Go about your work in peace, and begin by giving
      us some breakfast. My good fellow, you will give us the pleasure of dining
      with us?" My situation did not permit me to decline. I accepted
      accordingly, and we soon found ourselves seated before a leg of ham and a
      jug of Rhine wine. Other people arrived from time to time, and endeavored
      to elicit the confidence of Dame Grédel and Annette, but they maintained a
      discreet silence, for which they deserve no little credit. We spent the
      afternoon smoking our pipes and emptying our mugs; no one paid any
      attention to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief of police, in spite of his sallow face, piercing glance, pale
      lips, and sharp nose, was excellent company after a bottle or two; he told
      us some excellent stories, and at every word of his the other two burst
      out laughing. I remained gloomy and silent. "Come, young fellow!" he said
      with a smile, "forget for a little the death of your respectable
      grandmother. Take a drop, and put your troublesome thoughts to flight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Others joined in the conversation, and the time passed in the midst of
      tobacco smoke, the clinking of glasses, and the ringing of mugs. But at
      nine o'clock, after the watchman's visit, the expression of things
      changed. Madoc rose and said: "Well, my friends, let us proceed to
      business. Fasten the doors and shutters quietly! You, ladies, may go to
      bed!" His two tattered followers looked more like robbers themselves than
      like props of law and order. Each drew a club with a knob of lead attached
      to one end, from his trousers' leg, and Madoc tapped his breast pocket to
      make sure that his pistol was there. This done, he bid me lead them to the
      loft. We climbed the stairs. Having reached the little room, where
      thoughtful little Annette had taken care to light a fire, Madoc, cursing
      between his teeth, hastened to throw water on the coals; then motioning to
      the pile of straw, he said to me: "You may go to sleep if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, together with his two acolytes, at the end of the room close
      to the wall, and they put out the light. I lay down on the straw,
      breathing a prayer to the Almighty to send hither the assassin. After
      midnight the silence became so profound that you would never have
      suspected three men were there with wide-open eyes, on the alert for the
      slightest sound. The hours wore slowly away. I could not sleep. A thousand
      terrible ideas teemed in my brain. One o'clock&mdash;two o'clock&mdash;three
      o'clock struck, and nothing appeared. At three o'clock one of the
      officials stirred slightly. I thought the man had come at last. But again
      all was still. I began to think that Madoc would take me for an impostor,
      and that in the morning things would fare badly with me; thus, instead of
      helping my companions, I should only be fettered with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time seemed to me to pass very rapidly after three o'clock. I wished
      the night might last forever, that the only ray of hope might not be gone.
      I was starting to go over all these thoughts for the fiftieth time, when,
      suddenly, without my having heard a sound, the window opened and two eyes
      glistened in the opening. Nothing stirred in the loft. "The others are
      asleep," I thought. The head remained in the opening, listening. The
      wretch seemed to suspect something. My heart galloped and the blood
      coursed through my veins. I dared not even breathe. A few moments passed
      thus. Then, suddenly, the man seemed to make up his mind. He let himself
      down into the loft with the same caution as on the preceding night. On the
      instant a terrible cry, short, piercing, blood-curdling, resounded through
      the house. "We've got him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole house shook from cellar to attic; cries, struggles, and hoarse
      shouts, coupled with muttered oaths, filled the loft. The man roared like,
      a wild beast, and his opponents breathed painfully as they battled with
      his terrible strength. Then there was a crash that made the flooring
      creak, and I heard nothing more but a gritting of teeth and a rattle of
      chains. "A light here!" cried the formidable Madoc. And as the sulphur
      burned, illuminating the place with its bluish light, I vaguely
      distinguished the forms of the three officials kneeling above the
      prostrate man. One of them was holding him by the throat, another had sunk
      his knees into his chest, and Madoc encircled his wrists with handcuffs
      hard enough to crush them. The man, in his shirt sleeves as before, seemed
      inert, save that one of his powerful legs, naked from the knee to the
      ankle, raised up from time to time and struck the floor with a convulsive
      movement. His eyes were literally starting from his head, and his lips
      were covered with a bloody foam. Scarcely had I lighted the taper when the
      officials exclaimed, thunderstruck: "Our Dean!" All three got up and stood
      staring at each other, white with astonishment. The bloodshot eyes of the
      murderer turned on Madoc. He tried to speak, and after a moment I heard
      him murmur: "What a terrible dream! My God, what a terrible dream!" Then
      he sighed and became motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      I approached to take a look at him. It was indeed the man who had given us
      advice on the road to Heidelberg. Perhaps he had had a presentiment that
      we would be the means of his destruction, for people do sometimes have
      these terrible borebodings. As he did not stir, and a tiny stream of blood
      flowed on the dusty floor, Madoc, rousing himself from his stupor, bent
      over him and tore away his shirt; we then saw that he had stabbed himself
      to the heart with his great knife. "Ho! ho!" cried Madoc, with a sinister
      smile, "our Dean has cheated the gallows. You others stay here while I go
      and notify the bailiff." He picked up his hat, that had fallen off during
      the mêlée, and left without another word. I remained opposite the corpse,
      with the two others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news spread like wildfire. It was a sensation for the neighborhood.
      Dean Daniel Van den Berg enjoyed a fortune and a reputation so well
      established that many people refused to believe in the abominable
      instincts which dominated him. The matter was discussed from every
      conceivable point of view. Some held that he was a somnambulist and
      irresponsible for his acts; others that he was a murderer through love of
      blood, having no other possible motive for committing these crimes.
      Perhaps both were right, for it is an undeniable fact that moral being,
      will, soul, whatever name you choose to call it by, is wanting in the
      somnambulist. The animal nature left to itself naturally yields to the
      dictates of its pacific or sanguinary instincts. Be that as it may, my
      comrades were at once restored to liberty. Little Annette was quoted for a
      long time after as a model of devotion. She was even sought in marriage by
      the son of the burgomaster Trungott, a youth, who will one day disgrace
      his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, I lost no time in returning to the Black Forest, where, since
      that time I have officiated as leader of the orchestra at the Sabre Vert
      Tavern, on the road to Tubingen. If you should ever happen to pass that
      way, and my story has interested you, come in and see me. We will drink a
      bottle or two together, and I will relate to you certain details that will
      make your hair stand on end.
